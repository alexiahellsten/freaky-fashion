# Freaky Fashion

A school project of a fictional e-commerce site called "Freaky Fashion" built with HTML, CSS and some Bootstrap JS for the accordion as we weren't supposed to write any Javascript ourselves.

Features some funky CSS since I wanted to override Bootstraps standard styling without overriding it directly in the HTML.

**How to run:**
1. Download as ZIP and open the project folder or clone the repo in VSCode
3. Download and run Live server

You can go to the "admin" pages by typing in: `/admin/products/index.html` or `/admin/products/new.html` in the browser after the port number.
